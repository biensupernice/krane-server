Krane makes it easy to deploy containers on remote or local servers by interfacing with Docker to expose a productive toolset for managing containerized applications known as deployments. The Krane [CLI](https://www.krane.sh/#/docs/cli) allows you to interact with a Krane instace to run deployments, read container logs, store deployment secrets and more. The Krane [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/krane) automates deployments by tapping into your build pipeline to continuously deliver updates when changes occur to your projects.

## Features

- Single file deployments
- Deployment [aliases](https://www.krane.sh/#/docs/deployment?id=alias) (`my-api.localhost`)
- Deployment [secrets](https://www.krane.sh/#/docs/deployment?id=secrets) for hiding sensitive environment variables
- Deployment [scaling](https://www.krane.sh/#/docs/deployment?id=scale) to distribute the workload between containers
- Deployment [rate limit](https://www.krane.sh/#/docs/deployment?id=rate_limit) to limit incoming requests
- HTTPS/TLS support with auto generated [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates for your deployments
- [Self-hosted](#motivation) - Cost-effective, bring your own server and scale if you need

## Getting Started

[![Install Krane](docs/assets/1-install-krane.png)](https://www.krane.sh/#/docs/installation)

You can install Krane using this interactive script. 

It is by far the *easiest* and *fastest* way to **create** or **update** a Krane instance.

```
bash <(wget -qO- get.krane.sh)
```

Other [installation](https://www.krane.sh/#/docs/installation) methods and configurations.

[![Download CLI](docs/assets/2-download-cli.png)](https://www.krane.sh/#/docs/cli)

Download the Krane [CLI](https://www.krane.sh/#/docs/cli) to execute commands on a Krane instance.

```
npm i -g krane
```

Full list of [commands](https://www.krane.sh/#/docs/cli?id=commands).

[![Setup Authentication](docs/assets/3-setup-authentication.png)](https://www.krane.sh/#/docs/authentication)

Create public and private keys used for authentication.

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com" -m 'PEM' -f $HOME/.ssh/krane
```

The private key stays on the user's machine, the public key is appended to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` where Krane is running.

[![Authenticate](docs/assets/4-authentication.png)](https://www.krane.sh/#/docs/authentication)

When logging in, you'll be prompted for the endpoint where Krane is running and the public key you created in step 3. Once authenticated you'll be able to execute commands on that Krane instance.

```
krane login
```

To switch between Krane instances you'll have to login again.

[![Deploy](docs/assets/5-deploy.png)](https://www.krane.sh/#/docs/cli?id=deploy)

Create a deployment configuration file `deployment.json`

For example:

```json
{
  "name": "krane-getting-started",    
  "image": "docker/getting-started",
  "alias": ["getting-started.example.com"]
}
```

```
krane deploy -f /path/to/deployment.json
```

For more deployment configuration options, checkout the [documentation](https://www.krane.sh/#/docs/deployment).

## Motivation

Krane is a self-hosted PaaS. You bring your own server and install Krane on it to manage your containers in the form of deployments - The benefit, <i>cost per deployment</i>. A self-hosted solution allows you to own your server (cost-effective), and the benefit of any number of deployments at no extra cost. Maintaining and managing your own solution may sound complex, Krane tries to make the process <i>straight-forward</i> and <i>cost-effective</i> .

Krane isn't a replacement for [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), [ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/), or any other container orchestration solution you might see running production applications, instead it's a tool you can leverage to make development of side-projects or small workloads cheap and straight forward. That was the main objective, a productive deployment tool for managing non-critical container workloads on remote servers.

## Building from source

```
$ git clone https://github.com/krane/krane
$ cd krane
$ go build ./cmd/krane
$ export KRANE_PRIVATE_KEY=changeme
$ ./krane
```

## Running tests

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/krane/krane)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/krane/krane)
[![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/krane/krane?color=blue)](https://codecov.io/gh/krane/krane)

In the root of the project

```
# run tests
$ go test ./...

or

# run tests with coverage
$ go test -coverprofile coverage.out ./...

# view coverage
$ go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

## Viewing the database

Krane uses [boltdb](https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt) as its backing store. To view the contents in bolt, you can use [boltdbweb](https://github.com/evnix/boltdbweb).

```
$ boltdbweb --db-name=/path/to/krane.db --port=9000
```

## Minimal Docker example

This is the most minimal Docker example to get _up-and-running_ with Krane

```
docker run -d --name=krane \
    -e KRANE_PRIVATE_KEY=changeme \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh  \
    -p 8500:8500 biensupernice/krane
```

## Complete Docker example

This is a complete Docker example to get Krane running with:

- Automatic HTTPS/SSL w/ Lets Encrypt certificates
- Container registry authentication for pulling images
- Volumed Krane DB (for storing session & deployment details)
- Log level set to debug (for debugging)

```
docker run -d --name=krane \
    -e KRANE_PRIVATE_KEY=changeme \
    -e LOG_LEVEL=debug \
    -e DOCKER_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME=changeme \
    -e DOCKER_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=changeme \
    -e PROXY_ENABLED=true \
    -e PROXY_DASHBOARD_SECURE=true \
    -e PROXY_DASHBOARD_ALIAS=monitor.example.com \
    -e LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=email@example.com \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh  \
    -v /tmp/krane.db:/tmp/krane.db \
    -p 8500:8500 biensupernice/krane
```
